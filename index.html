            <p>
                Thinking back to this time last year, most of us were looking forward to getting out of 2020 and hoping
                that 2021 would be a more normal year. It wasn’t. And it seems likely that 2022 will not be
                straightforward either. But the fact is we all have to be focused on how we can change our surroundings
                and the situation.

            <p>COVID-19 vaccination is an important tool to help stop the pandemic.
                Stopping a pandemic requires using all the tools we have available. Wearing masks and social distancing
                help
                reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others, but these measures are not
                enough. Vaccines work with your immune system, so it will be ready to fight the virus if you are
                exposed.
